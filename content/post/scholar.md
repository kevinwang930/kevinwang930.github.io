## John M. Mellor-Crummey

Professor of Computer Science, Rice University

Contributions:
1. [Algorithms for scalable synchronization on shared-memory multiprocessors](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/103727.103729)

## Travis Craig
University of Washington retired.
Invented FIFO and priority-queuing spin locks using only atomic swap and local spinning on coherent-cache or NUMA machines. One is now known as the CLH lock.

Contributions:
1. Building FIFO and Priority-Queuing Spin Locks from Atomic Swap

## [Algorithms for scalable synchronization on shared-memory multiprocessors](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/103727.103729)

the paper introduces spin locks and barries based on spin lock.the spin lock part is genius. but other contents seems difficult to comprehend.


## [Building FIFO and Priority-Queuing Spin Locks from Atomic Swap](https://dada.cs.washington.edu/research/tr/1993/02/UW-CSE-93-02-02.pdf)
The content of the paper seems very common.

## [Queue locks on cache coherent multiprocessors](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=f20bb59b95d2eb95013d386cde3f8969ffd7f0b7)
compare the performance, memory and cpu cost of different spin locks
