Encryption is commonly used in web, this article try to explore the encryption algorithms and tools used in encryption

# Algorithms

# hex

hex transform every octet to 2 hex from 0~F

# Base64 
Base64 is a group of binary-to-text encoding schemes that transform binary data into a sequence of printable characters.
The source binary data is taken 6 bits at a time, then this group of 6 bits is mapped to one of 64 unique characters.
Base64 transform every 3 octets to 4 characters in base64 table. with "=" as padding. 
Base64 compression is better than hex.


## AES
Advanced Encryption Standard  established in 2001, supersedes the DES(Data Decryption Standard). It is a symmetric-key algorithm.

AES-128 request 128-bits key which can be generated by openssl
```
openssl rand -out ase.key 16
```


# Security Mechanism 

## SASL

Simple Authentication and Security Layer(SASL) is a framework for authentication and data security in internet protocols. It decouple authentication mechanisms from application protocols.
